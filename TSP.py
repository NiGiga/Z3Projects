            ### Traveling Salesman Problem, TSP ###

The goal is to find the shortest route that allows a salesperson 
to visit all the cities of a set once and return to the city 
of departure.


                        ### Formula ###

### 1 Each city is visited only once

### 2 The route must form a cycle: the salesman must return to 
###   the city of departure.

### 3 Total distance minimization: 
      The goal is to reduce the total distance traveled in the cycle.

                          ### Idea ###
                          
I define a simplified version with a matrix of distances between 
cities, using variables to represent the sequence of cities visited.
